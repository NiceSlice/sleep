            <h1>Not sleeping is risky business</h1>

            <br>

            <p>
                Getting enough sleep is necessary for many crucial mechanisms that affect our health and well-being.
                Not getting enough sleep can lead to health issues and behavior disorders.
                Some of the risks are listed here.
            </p>
            <p>
                The role of sleeping in retaining memories is well known.
                Without sufficient sleep our brains are not able to acquire new memories and this also prevents us from learning new skills and abilities.
                This includes memories of places, other people, conversations, knowledge gained from books and other learning materials, as well as physical and motor skills like playing musical instruments or sports.
            </p>
            <p>
                A strong correlation was found between lack of sleep in adult stage and development of Alzheimer's disease.
                If an individual is not getting enough sleep over a longer period of time, there is an increased chance of pre-diabetes and diabetes development.
            </p>

            <p>
                Insufficient sleep also leads to increased sensitivity of amygdala, which is responsible for triggering angry and raging reactions.
                In the long term over-sensitivity of amygdala can lead to behavior disorder.
                In children the lack of sleep can manifest itself through aggression and bullying tendencies.
                In this sense, getting the necessary sleep can increase calmness and life satisfaction.
